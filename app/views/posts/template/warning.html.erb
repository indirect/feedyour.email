<p>
  This feed has recieved <%= pluralize @feed.week_posts.count, "post" %> in the last week. Our free infrastructure is only able to support 14 emails in any 7 day period, and emails beyond that amount will be rejected.

<p>
  If you're interested in a paid feed that supports more emails, drop me a line at <%= mail_to "andre@arko.net" %> so we can work something out.
