uing=C2=A0a non-fungible token exchange (the defendant, OpenSea)=C2=A0for a=
llegedly negligently causing him to lose=C2=A0his NFT in the Bored Ape Yach=
t Club collection. He would like his ape back:Plaintiff is the rightful own=
er of Bored Ape #3475. On or about February 7, 2022, Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bo=
red Ape was stolen, listed, and sold to another individual on Defendant [Op=
enSea]=E2=80=99s platform. Plaintiff did not list his Bored Ape for sale on=
 the marketplace. Defendant=E2=80=99s security vulnerability allowed an out=
side party to illegally enter through OpenSea=E2=80=99s code and access Pla=
intiff=E2=80=99s NFT wallet, in order to list and sell Plaintiff=E2=80=99s =
Bored Ape at a literal fraction of the value (at .01 ETH). Essentially, Ope=
nSea=E2=80=99s vulnerabilities allowed others to enter through its code and=
 force the listing of an NFT. This is through no fault of the owner.After t=
his forced entry through OpenSea code, and immediate purchase/sale, it was =
then immediately resold at 99 ETH, which is still vastly below value, based=
 on the rarity of the Bored Ape. ...Prior to the filing of this lawsuit, Pl=
aintiff attempted to resolve the issue numerous times with Defendant. Defen=
dant ignored Plaintiff. Defendant claimed to be =E2=80=9Cactively investiga=
ting=E2=80=9D the issue, yet as of the filing of this Complaint, Defendant =
has failed to reverse the transaction, return the Bored Ape, and/or provide=
 any adequate remedy=C2=A0Plaintiff also attempted to resolve the issue wit=
h the individual who currently possesses Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored Ape. The=
 individual refused to return it.Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored Ape has signific=
ant value; this is unquestionable. For example, Justin Bieber purchased Bor=
ed Ape #3001 for 500 ETH, or $1.3 million at the time of the transaction. B=
ieber=E2=80=99s Bored Ape has a rarity score of only 53.66 and a rarity ran=
k of #9777. In contrast, Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored Ape has a rarity score o=
f 138.52 and a rarity rank of #1392. It is in the=C2=A0top 14% rarity, and =
it is significantly rarer than Bieber=E2=80=99s. Thus, Plaintiff=E2=80=99s =
Bored Ape=E2=80=99s value is arguably in the millions of dollars and growin=
g as each day passes.I know this is normal now, this is just life in 2022, =
this ship has sailed. Still, imagine telling a federal judge =E2=80=9Csee, =

says.All of that seems fine, really, but the path by which we have arrived =
here is strange. The idea of crypto was to create a sort of property that c=
ould be evidenced through code, where ownership was decentralized and permi=
ssionless rather than intermediated through some traditional=C2=A0authority=
. And=C2=A0it worked, and NFTs became worth millions of dollars, which made=
 them far too valuable to be subjected to the uncertainty of decentralized =
permissionless ownership. And so now if someone takes your apes on the bloc=
kchain, you can try to get them back in federal court. =E2=80=9CWhy is this=

The way some financial products work is that they are listed on an exchange=

and your order goes to the exchange and a bunch of robots compete to fill i=
t in a millisecond at some algorithmically determined price. The way some o=
ther financial products work is that they are traded by like six banks, and=
 if you want to buy some you call one of the six traders who trades them, a=
nd if three of those traders are on vacation or at lunch the entire market =
goes haywire. Here=E2=80=99s a fun Bloomberg News story about  inflation tr=

There are two basic sorts of shareholder activism in the U.S. In one kind, =
which I am going to call =E2=80=9Cbig activism,=E2=80=9D a hedge fund manag=
er buys a largeish stake in a public company (often about 5% to 9%, though =
generally less at a really big company) and tries to get it to make big cha=
nges. Sometimes the activist works via private negotiations, press releases=
, etc., but if the company says no then ultimately the activist will mount =
a proxy fight. She will nominate several candidates for the company=E2=80=
=99s board of directors, write a proxy statement supporting their candidacy=
, and launch a campaign to convince other big shareholders to vote for her =
slate. This will cost her millions of dollars to pay lawyers, proxy solicit=
ors, public-relations consultants and other professionals. If her slate win=
s a majority of the votes, she wins: Director elections are binding, and if=
 her candidates win then they join the board of directors (and the company=
=E2=80=99s candidates get kicked off). Then her candidates can implement wh=
atever big changes she was arguing for. Given the high stakes of this proce=
ss, many proxy fights settle: The company offers the activist a few board s=
eats and/or some other concessions in order to avoid a contested vote.The r=
easons=C2=A0the activist spends all this money are:=09She thinks=C2=A0the s=
tock will go up if the company does the thing she wants, and=09She owns a l=
ot of the stock, so if it goes up she=E2=80=99ll make money.The reasons the=
 activist buys all that stock are:=09If she owns the shares, she can vote f=
or her slate, which will help her win the proxy fight, and=09The whole poin=
t of this is to own a lot of shares to make money when she wins and the sto=
ck goes up.In the other kind of activism, which I will call =E2=80=9Csmall =
activism,=E2=80=9D an individual investor, labor union pension fund, religi=
ous order or other ideologically motivated person buys 100 shares of stock =
in some company that is doing something she doesn=E2=80=99t like, and then =
files a =E2=80=9Cshareholder proposal=E2=80=9D asking the company to do som=
ething different. In general this will relate to some sort of environmental=
, social or governance thing; the activist will want the company to pollute=
 less or have more diverse leaders or have a board chair who is not its chi=
ef executive officer.=C2=A0The company generally has to include this propos=
al in its own proxy statement,[1] and the shareholders get to vote on it. T=
his comes with relatively little=C2=A0expense for the activist: She doesn=
=E2=80=99t prepare her own proxy statement or hire director candidates or i=
ncur a lot of legal or solicitation expenses.=C2=A0The downside is that the=
 proposal is usually of the form =E2=80=9Cthe shareholders humbly, but non-=
bindingly, request the company to consider writing a report about the possi=
ble benefits of doing the thing.=E2=80=9D Even if all the shareholders vote=
 for the activist=E2=80=99s proposal, (1) the proposal often will not=C2=A0=
demand that the company change any substantive behavior and (2) the company=
 can ignore it anyway.Traditionally, the big activists ask companies to do =
financial or strategic things =E2=80=94=C2=A0spin off a division, look for =
a merger, do a big stock buyback, get into a new line of business or get ou=
t of an old one,=C2=A0etc. =E2=80=94=C2=A0because those are the things that=
 make the stock go up, while small activists=C2=A0ask companies to do ESG t=
hings, because those are the things that can be addressed in shareholder pr=
oposals and that labor unions and religious orders and individual hobbyists=
 care about. But big institutions increasingly care about ESG things, and t=
here are good arguments that doing good ESG things can make a company=E2=80=
=99s stock go up. (Because good ESG things increase cash flows in the long =
run, or just because ESG investors will buy more of the stock.) So you migh=
t expect to see more ESG-focused big activism these days, and indeed there =
has been some. We  talked last year about Dan Loeb=E2=80=99s efforts to get=
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc to split up, which in many ways is a traditional big=
 activist effort =E2=80=94=C2=A0Loeb is an activist hedge fund manager, he=
=C2=A0built a $750 million stake in Shell, he wants a corporate split-up =
=E2=80=94=C2=A0but uses ESG arguments.But there is also a hybrid form of ac=
tivism in which hedge funds use the tools of big activism =E2=80=94=C2=A0th=
reatening letters and investor presentations and=C2=A0board nominations and=
 proxy fights =E2=80=94=C2=A0without=C2=A0building a big stake first. We al=
so  talked last year about an ESG-focused proxy fight at Exxon Mobil Corp.,=
 which the activist (Engine No. 1 LLC) won, despite only owning a smallish =
sliver of shares. This was a weird fight, I pointed out: Engine No. 1 spent=
 some $30 million on a proxy fight that could not possibly pay off for it f=
inancially.  There was an explanation, of course: Engine No. 1 is a newish =
manager trying to attract investors, and having a high-profile proxy-fight =
win is very good for business.[2]And now=C2=A0here=E2=80=99s this:Carl Icah=
n has launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald=E2=80=99s Corp=
., as the activist investor pushes the fast-food chain to require its suppl=
iers to change their treatment of pigs.Mr. Icahn has a very small McDonald=
=E2=80=99s stake and had been in talks with the company alongside the Human=
e Society of the United States for several weeks, The Wall Street Journal r=
eported earlier this month.After the Journal reported Sunday that Mr. Icahn=
 had nominated two directors, McDonald=E2=80=99s confirmed it in a statemen=
t and said the board would evaluate his nominees.At issue is McDonald=E2=80=
=99s suppliers=E2=80=99 use of so-called gestation crates, which are small =
cages used to constrain pregnant pigs.In 2012, McDonald=E2=80=99s pledged t=
o stop buying pork by 2022 from producers who use the crates. Few knew at t=
he time that Mr. Icahn quietly had pushed for the changes behind the scenes=
.Now, 10 years later, Mr. Icahn and the Humane Society are arguing that McD=
onald=E2=80=99s failed to follow through and changed its interpretation of =
the pledge. McDonald=E2=80=99s now often has its producers move pigs out of=
 the containers only after confirming they are pregnant, which many wait to=
 do so until the sows are four to six weeks into their 16-week pregnancies.=
Icahn apparently owns 200 shares of McDonald=E2=80=99s, worth about $50,000=
, which is not nothing, but which=C2=A0is=C2=A0nothing to Carl Icahn (whose=
 net worth Bloomberg puts at $23.6 billion) or McDonald=E2=80=99s (which ha=
s a market capitalization of about $190 billion). In a practical sense=C2=
=A0Carl Icahn is mounting a proxy fight at McDonald=E2=80=99s=C2=A0without =

 for financial reasons. It is the hobbyist sort of activism =E2=80=94=C2=A0=
small stake, ESG issue, personal interest =E2=80=94=C2=A0but done via an ex=
pensive proxy fight. Potentially, I mean; I am not sure that Icahn will put=
 as much money into this as he does into proxy fights where he has a larger=
 stake. But if he does, he definitely will not make it up on the stock pric=
e.I assume there won=E2=80=99t be=C2=A0too=C2=A0much of this; it is unusual=
 for someone to simultaneously be (1) a billionaire professional hedge fund=
 activist with the money and skill to contest a proxy fight at a large publ=
ic company and also (2) interested in pushing for change at a company for p=
urely humanitarian reasons. Still! The lesson of Engine No. 1, and of the f=
ocus on ESG in general, is that it is possible to win a proxy fight without=
 owning very many shares yourself, if you can appeal to the ESG interests o=
f big institutional shareholders. I am not sure I=E2=80=99d expect Carl Ica=
hn to win a proxy fight here, but a few years ago I would have been shocked=
 to see him even start one. Now the ESG proxy fight seems almost normal.

 the lawyer telling Musk not to send an arguably material tweet, not becaus=

:=C2=A0The world is not as black and white as many tech founders wish it wa=
s, and the legal system is not just a list of unambiguous written rules app=
lied in a mechanical fashion. Whether you like it or not, regulators and co=
urts operate in large areas of discretion; they have lots of ways to make l=
ife more difficult for you and for the=C2=A0company that you manage as a fi=
duciary for others, and they are used to being treated with a certain amoun=
t of deference by the people they regulate. Here they have you dead to righ=

our overall attitude and behavior. My job as a lawyer is not just to look u=

about how officials will react to particular fact patterns, and to advise y=

      Everything is securities fraud
   =20
 =20
I  often say that every bad thing that happens at a public company can be c=
haracterized as securities fraud: =E2=80=9CYou didn=E2=80=99t tell us about=
 the bad thing,=E2=80=9D shareholders say, =E2=80=9Cso we bought the stock =
and it went down and we were deceived.=E2=80=9D Covid-19 is, among other th=
ings, a bad thing that happened to pretty much every public company: Most s=
tocks went down in March 2020 due to Covid-19, and you could have a range o=
f theories about how each company deceived its shareholders about the poten=
tial impact of a pandemic, etc. But here is an article finding only 54 secu=
rities-fraud lawsuits against U.S. public companies about Covid-19, includi=
ng only seven against S&P 500 companies.[3] The lesson is perhaps that I am=
 exaggerating about=C2=A0everything=C2=A0being securities fraud: If some un=
foreseen exogenous bad event hits every company at the same time, they won=
=E2=80=99t=C2=A0all=C2=A0get securities fraud lawsuits; you need something =
extra to turn a universal bad thing into a specific company=E2=80=99s secur=

 was stolen, listed, and sold to another individual on Defendant [OpenSea]=
=E2=80=99s platform. Plaintiff did not list his Bored Ape for sale on the m=
arketplace. Defendant=E2=80=99s security vulnerability allowed an outside p=
arty to illegally enter through OpenSea=E2=80=99s code and access Plaintiff=
=E2=80=99s NFT wallet, in order to list and sell Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored =
Ape at a literal fraction of the value (at .01 ETH). Essentially, OpenSea=
=E2=80=99s vulnerabilities allowed others to enter through its code and for=
ce the listing of an NFT. This is through no fault of the owner.</p><p styl=
e=3D"margin: 16px 0;">After this forced entry through OpenSea code, and imm=

 reverse the transaction, return the Bored Ape, and/or provide any adequate=

ast, Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored Ape has a rarity score of 138.52 and a rarit=
y rank of #1392. It is in the=C2=A0top 14% rarity, and it is significantly =
rarer than Bieber=E2=80=99s. Thus, Plaintiff=E2=80=99s Bored Ape=E2=80=99s =
