Here is a simplistic, wrong, but almost plausible history of stock-market i=
nvesting:=09Stock markets were invented to let people finance productive bu=
sinesses and share in the profits. You and 100 other people give a railroad=
 company some money to build tracks, it builds tracks, it runs trains, it m=
akes money, it pays you all a nice 7% dividend out of the money it makes.=
=09Markets quickly became a way for=C2=A0people to gamble on speculative ve=
ntures. You couldn=E2=80=99t get a ton of financial information about those=
 investments, so you were just guessing which ones were good. You bought st=
ocks because you thought other people would buy them. =E2=80=9CThe professi=
onal investor is forced to concern himself with the anticipation of impendi=
ng changes, in the news or in the atmosphere, of the kind by which experien=
ce shows that the mass psychology of the market is most influenced,=E2=80=
=9D  wrote Keynes in 1936. =E2=80=9CThe actual, private object of the most =
skilled investment today is =E2=80=98to beat the gun,=E2=80=99 as the Ameri=
cans so well express it, to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depre=
ciating, half-crown to the other fellow.=E2=80=9D If you wanted to analyze =
how much to pay for a stock, you would concern yourself with questions of=
=C2=A0mood. You would =E2=80=9Cread the tape,=E2=80=9D get a sense of how t=
he market=C2=A0felt, and then buy if you thought people were going to be bu=
llish and sell if you thought they=E2=80=99d be bearish. The profits of the=
 underlying business=C2=A0might=C2=A0affect the mood, but they were not you=
r primary concern. The mood was.=09But in 1934,  Benjamin Graham invented d=
iscounted cash flow analysis,[1] and stocks became (again) a way to bet on =
the future profits of productive enterprises. If you wanted to analyze a st=
ock, you=E2=80=99d analyze its operations and build a spreadsheet and predi=
ct its future financial results and do some math to those results to get a =
current value. If the value was higher than the price, you=E2=80=99d buy th=
e stock. There were reasons that this approach became dominant. The crash o=
f 1929 and the ensuing depression meant that the mood was=C2=A0bad, so inve=
sting in productive businesses was relatively more attractive than betting =
on mass enthusiasm. The creation of the modern US system of securities regu=
lation in the 1930s meant that stock manipulation was=C2=A0harder to do, wh=
ile getting financial information about companies was easier: You actually=
=C2=A0could=C2=A0analyze cash flows. But, also, doing math to sober busines=
s analyses just seems more=C2=A0professional. If investing is a game of mas=
s psychology and gambling, then it is not quite respectable=C2=A0to make yo=
ur living from it. If investing is a business of building complex quantitat=
ive models to allocate capital to its best uses, then it is much more reput=
able and impressive, and you can hire lots of Harvard applied-math majors t=
o do it.=09In roughly 2021 the pendulum swung back again. Now the way you i=
nvest in stocks is by guessing which stocks other people will want to buy, =
math and financial statements are worthless, and the reputable finance busi=
nesspeople keep getting blown up by online gamblers.And so now, if you want=
 to analyze the value of a stock, you will   ask questions like =E2=80=9Cwh=
en do college students come back to school and start gambling again?=E2=80=
=9DThe recent resurgence in retail-trading favorites won=E2=80=99t let up a=
nytime soon, says Jaime Rogozinski, founder of the popular chat forum WallS=
treetBets.=E2=80=9CSummer vacation is over, everyone is back in school and =
that=E2=80=99s when the activity gets to kick back up,=E2=80=9D Rogozinski =
said in an interview with Bloomberg Markets.The drivers are the same as the=
y were in January 2021: relatively distressed, highly shorted companies are=
 once again getting pushed higher by day trader enthusiasm. And the frenzy =
is likely to continue =E2=80=9Cas long as we don=E2=80=99t disable a buy bu=
tton,=E2=80=9D says Rogozinski, who no longer moderates the Reddit forum.=
=C2=A0On the other hand here=E2=80=99s a college student who  made the most=
 of his summer vacation:A 20-year-old university student has made a roughly=
 $110mn gain by selling a stake in struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond, a=
fter its stock price soared during a month of frenzied trading reminiscent =
of last year=E2=80=99s meme stock boom.Jake Freeman, an applied mathematics=
 and economics major at the University of Southern California, acquired nea=
rly 5mn shares in Bed Bath & Beyond in July, according to regulatory filing=
s, after dismal earnings and the ousting of its chief executive sent its st=
ock price plummeting.Freeman bought his stake at under $5.50 a share. On Tu=
esday, Bed Bath & Beyond surged to more than $27 a share. As the stock soar=
ed, Freeman sold more than $130mn worth of stock from his TD Ameritrade and=
 Interactive Brokers accounts.Freeman=E2=80=99s sale was well-timed. Shares=
 in Bed Bath & Beyond tumbled more than 20 per cent on Thursday after the i=
nvestor and meme-stock champion Ryan Cohen disclosed on Wednesday evening t=
hat he intended to sell his entire stake of almost 12 per cent in the compa=
ny.That=E2=80=99s from the Financial Times last Thursday; here is a follow-=
up about how Freeman tried to give Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. some  meme-y corp=
orate finance advice:The novel solution he proposed for Bed Bath involved u=
sing the high volatility in its stock price to offer bondholders a deal tha=
t would lighten its senior debt load from $1.2bn to $500mn. The plan hinged=
 on the company offering stock warrants and convertible notes to debt holde=
rs in exchange for reducing the company=E2=80=99s leverage. If the company =
repaired its balance sheet and the share price recovered, the warrants woul=
d go up in value.Here=E2=80=99s his  July letter to the company outlining t=
he proposal. In one sense it=E2=80=99s a fairly straightforward distressed =
debt restructuring idea: If you=E2=80=99re a company with bonds trading at =
20 to 40 cents on the dollar,[2] then you can try to buy those bonds back f=
or 30 to 50 cents=E2=80=99 worth of new bonds, giving=C2=A0you=C2=A0less de=
bt and your bondholders a nice profit. In another sense, it is a complicate=
d way to say =E2=80=9Clook, you are a meme stock, which means that investor=
s want to YOLO your call options, so what you should do is create some call=
 options and sell them to pay off your debt.=E2=80=9D Warrants and converti=
bles are company-issued call options, and call options are the meme-iest wa=
y to trade meme stocks.Really the corporate-finance advice that you=E2=80=
=99d=C2=A0like=C2=A0to give to a meme-stock issuer is: Every Monday, if you=
r stock is trading at $10, sell a bunch of warrants with a $20 strike price=
 expiring on Friday, for say $1 each.=C2=A0If your stock doubles, you sold =
stock at $20, which is a lot better than you expected. If, much more likely=
, your stock doesn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0double, then you=E2=80=99ve made a free $=
1, every week. People want to overpay to gamble on your stock =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0they are buying short-dated listed call options anyway =E2=80=94=C2=A0so=
 you might as well let them overpay you. In practice this is tricky: It=C2=
=A0seems weird to do=C2=A0one-week=C2=A0warrants, and anyway a warrant isn=
=E2=80=99t quite the same thing as a weekly listed call option.=C2=A0(In fa=
ct warrants on meme-y stocks seem much=C2=A0less=C2=A0attractive to retail =
investors than the underlying stock.[3]) Still, the basic advice of =E2=80=
=9Cyou are a meme stock so you ought to be selling options to gamblers=E2=
=80=9D feels correct.Notice, though, that Bed Bath & Beyond ignored his adv=
ice and the stock soared for  purely meme reasons:In August, Bed Bath share=
s started soaring following renewed momentum on Reddit, where moderators of=
 the WallStreetBets channel had lifted a ban on discussing the stock. It ca=
talysed a furious rally in Bed Bath shares that Freeman said caught him off=
 guard. =E2=80=9C[People] were really hyping it up on WallStreetBets, which=
 just led to more and more fear of missing out,=E2=80=9D he said.At the sta=
rt of last week, the shares climbed higher still after Ryan Cohen, the chai=
r of GameStop and a meme stock figurehead, filed documents with the SEC on =
Monday detailing a previous=C2=A0purchase in February and March of a large =
number of call options in Bed Bath =E2=80=94 derivatives that can deliver a=
 windfall if a stock rises in value.It=E2=80=99s not cleverly harnessing me=
me-stock volatility to clean up the balance sheet. It=E2=80=99s message boa=
rds and misreading=C2=A0the actions of =E2=80=9Ca meme stock figurehead.=E2=
=80=9D It=E2=80=99s mass psychology, not corporate finance. In a sense, if =
you buy a big chunk of a meme stock and give the company advice on how to d=
o meme corporate finance, you are doing the right thing. (Meme-stock activi=
sts =E2=80=9Ccan nudge companies to be dumber so their stocks will go up,=
=E2=80=9D   I once wrote.) In another sense, if you buy a meme stock and th=
ink about corporate finance at all, you are making a mistake.In other meme-=
stock news, I entirely missed   the rise and fall of AMTD Digital Inc. this=
 summer, which I feel pretty good about. At its peak it was worth $470 bill=
ion, and not because of cash flows.

      What=E2=80=99s Adam Neumann up to?
   =20
 =20
An important   running   theme of this column is that one of the best thing=
s you can do for your financial career is lose a billion dollars. This is n=
ot necessarily=C2=A0actionable=C2=A0advice, for most people; it requires so=
meone trusting you with a billion dollars to lose. But if you ever do find =
yourself in a position where you can lose a billion dollars of someone else=
=E2=80=99s money, and you do it, that could open up a lot of doors to you. =
Losing a billion dollars tends to be a high-profile affair;=C2=A0it will de=
finitely get your name out there. People will be impressed that you were en=
trusted with a billion dollars, and that you took a big swing and lost it. =
And they will assume that you learned important lessons and, next time, won=
=E2=80=99t lose it.I doubt anyone has ever incinerated more venture-capital=
ist money with   more delirious joy than WeWork Inc. founder Adam Neumann, =
so  he gets to try again:Neumann=E2=80=99s new company Flow wants to transf=
orm the residential rental real estate market. Notably, it has the financia=
l support of Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capi=
tal firm that was an early investor in everything from Facebook to Airbnb. =
The backing of Andreessen Horowitz, considered royalty among early-stage in=
vestors, is a powerful sign of support, and perhaps a rebuke to Neumann=E2=
=80=99s critics, who have described his leadership of WeWork as a cautionar=
y tale of corporate hubris.Andreessen Horowitz is investing about $350 mill=
ion in Flow, according to three people briefed on the deal. The investment,=
 the largest individual check Andreessen Horowitz has ever written in a rou=
nd of funding to a company, values Flow at more than $1 billion before it e=
ven officially opens its doors.Here=E2=80=99s Marc Andreessen=E2=80=99s  bl=
og post about the investment:Adam is a visionary leader who revolutionized =
the second largest asset class in the world =E2=80=94 commercial real estat=
e =E2=80=94 by bringing community and brand to an industry in which neither=
 existed before. Adam, and the story of WeWork, have been exhaustively chro=
nicled, analyzed, and fictionalized =E2=80=93 sometimes accurately. For all=
 the energy put into covering the story, it=E2=80=99s often under appreciat=
ed that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience =
and led a paradigm-changing global company in the process: Adam Neumann. We=
 understand how difficult it is to build something like this and we love se=
eing repeat-founders build on past successes by growing from lessons learne=
d. For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty and we are excited to go =
on this journey with him and his colleagues building the future of living.W=
e think it is natural that for his first venture since WeWork, Adam returns=
 to the theme of connecting people through transforming their physical spac=
es and building communities where people spend the most time: their homes. =
Residential real estate =E2=80=94 the world=E2=80=99s largest asset class =
=E2=80=94 is ready for exactly this change.You can sort of model the Andree=

      Anti-ESG
   =20
 =20
The problem is that =E2=80=9CESG=E2=80=9D can be used to refer to several s=
lightly different things[4]:=09An ESG investor might look at environmental,=
 social and governance factors to evaluate the financial prospects and risk=
s of an investment. If sea levels rise, this coastal-hotels business might =
be in trouble; if the world gets serious about combatting climate change an=
d so imposes restrictions on carbon emissions, this coal-mining business mi=
ght not be able to sell its coal. These are financial risks like any other,=
 and should inform investment decisions.=09A big diversified investor that =
owns lots of shares of lots of companies will spend most of her time thinki=
ng about systematic risks, because she has diversified away idiosyncratic r=
isk. Climate change or social upheaval might be bad for all of her companie=
s, so when she talks to the managers of her companies she will spend less t=
ime telling them how to optimize their widget factories and more time askin=
g them about global warming.=09An investor who wants, not just to make mone=
y for herself, but also to make the world better, might try to do that thro=
ugh her investing. (By buying stocks of good companies and avoiding stocks =
of evil companies, or by buying stocks of evil companies and lobbying them =
to stop doing evil things, or something else.)=09An asset manager who wants=
 to make a lot of money might change the name of the XYZ Large-Cap Fund to =
the XYZ ESG Fund, without making many other changes, because (1) lots of in=
vestors want ESG funds, (2) they don=E2=80=99t particularly care about what=
 is in those funds, and (3) you can charge=C2=A0higher fees for=C2=A0ESG fu=
nds.For a long time, it was useful for big asset managers not to insist too=
 much on any distinctions between these things. If your clients vaguely ass=
ume that you are=C2=A0both=C2=A0maximizing their returns by being thoughtfu=
l about systemic risks,=C2=A0and=C2=A0making the world better, then they wi=
ll be happy to pay your fees.=C2=A0But these things=C2=A0are=C2=A0different=
, and in some tension. In particular, not everyone agrees on what will make=
 the world better, and ESG-investing-as-environmental-activism has become p=
olitically controversial and might no longer be good advertising. But ESG-i=
nvesting-as-a-way-to-look-at-systematic-risks remains important. If you are=
 a big systematic investor and you genuinely think that no one will use coa=
l in 10 years, then you probably won=E2=80=99t want to fund a coal mine. Bu=
t you=E2=80=99ll make that call quietly, because if some US politicians fin=
d out that you are =E2=80=9Cdiscriminating=E2=80=9D against coal=C2=A0then =
you=E2=80=99ll get in trouble and lose business. The ESG financial analysis=
=C2=A0makes sense, but the feel-good ESG marketing overlay doesn't work the=
 way it used to.Anyway here=E2=80=99s a Bloomberg News article from last we=
ek about how ESG people  don=E2=80=99t like to say =E2=80=9CESG=E2=80=9D an=
ymore:A number of sustainable investing champions say it=E2=80=99s time for=
 the =E2=80=9CESG=E2=80=9D label to be shelved and replaced by something le=
ss likely to draw attacks from both the political right and left.Robert Ecc=
les, a professor who=E2=80=99s spent the past 12 years researching sustaina=
bility at Harvard Business School and now University of Oxford=E2=80=99s Sa=
id Business School, says the term =E2=80=9Cjust doesn=E2=80=99t have value =
anymore. Let=E2=80=99s change the conversation.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=A6Instead, =
he says he=E2=80=99s happy to talk about =E2=80=9Cmaterial risk factors.=E2=
=80=9D=E2=80=9CI know it=E2=80=99s a boring term, but it=E2=80=99s accurate=
,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CWe never have to say whether they=E2=80=99re a=
n E, S or G issue. We can say we=E2=80=99re talking about carbon emissions =
or labor practices.=E2=80=9DI=E2=80=99ll probably still say =E2=80=9CESG,=
=E2=80=9D but I see where they=E2=80=99re coming from.

      Equifax insider trading
   =20
 =20
In July 2017, credit reporting company Equifax Inc. was hacked, disclosing =
=E2=80=9Cpersonally identifiable information of millions of consumers.=E2=
=80=9D In September 2017, Equifax publicly disclosed the hack, and its stoc=
k fell 14%. In between those events, Equifax apparently went around telling=
 lots of people about the hack without disclosing it publicly, and all of t=
hem insider traded? I mean,   not really all of them. But it is striking   =
how many  insider trading cases came out of that hack. One model here is th=
at Equifax mobilized an unusual number of people to look into the hack, man=
y of them were not seasoned financial professionals, and so a lot of them i=
nsider traded in dumb obvious ways that got them caught. Another model is t=
hat insider trading on a data breach is somehow more offensive=C2=A0than in=
sider trading on, say, a merger, so the Securities and Exchange Commission =
put more effort into catching insider traders=C2=A0than it usually does.Any=
way here=E2=80=99s a good one from last week:The SEC's complaint, filed in =
the Northern District of Georgia, states that Equifax engaged a Chicago-bas=
ed public relations firm in August 2017 to assist with handling the inquiri=
es expected to be generated by the announcement of the intrusion and breach=
. According to the complaint, Ann M. Dishinger, who worked as a finance man=
ager at the public relations firm, learned about the Equifax breach through=
 her position and tipped her significant other, Lawrence M. Palmer (L. Palm=
er), with the nonpublic news. The SEC alleges that L. Palmer then contacted=
 a former business client and arranged for the client to purchase out-of-th=
e-money Equifax put options in the client's brokerage account with the unde=
rstanding that the client and L. Palmer would split any trading profits obt=
ained.The guy was the romantic partner of finance manager at a public relat=
ions firm hired by Equifax=E2=80=99s outside counsel, which is pretty far r=
emoved from the source of the information; if he knew about the hack and tr=
aded on it, think about how many other people did. And Palmer was allegedly=
 unsophisticated enough  that he had to ask =E2=80=9Ca former business asso=
ciate=E2=80=9D of his =E2=80=9Cfor advice on how to purchase options that w=
ould take advantage of what he thought would be bad news for the company.=
=E2=80=9D The associate recommended put options and apparently gave Palmer =
a brief options tutorial, and then Palmer allegedly =E2=80=9Casked his form=
er business associate to purchase $1,000 in Equifax put options in his brok=
erage account, claiming that he himself did not have a brokerage account an=
d suggesting that the circumstances were so urgent that he did not have tim=
e to open his own account.=E2=80=9DThe associate bought the options, and th=
en this allegedly happened:L. Palmer later reimbursed his former business a=
ssociate for $1,000 of the funds used to purchase the put options. In the m=
emo section of the check, L. Palmer wrote the words =E2=80=9CBlue Horseshoe=
.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=9CBlue Horseshoe=E2=80=9D was an apparent reference to Mic=
hael Douglas=E2=80=99s instruction to Charlie Sheen in the 1987 movie=C2=A0=
Wall Street=C2=A0to use a coded message to convey inside information, namel=
y, =E2=80=9C[y]ou tell the man that Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.=E2=
=80=9DWhat!? I promise, the SEC has seen =E2=80=9CWall Street.=E2=80=9D You=
=E2=80=99d be better off writing =E2=80=9Cillegal insider trading=E2=80=9D =
in the memo section of the check.   My assumption is that everyone who uses=
 codewords to commit crimes is doing so because it=C2=A0feels cool, not bec=
ause they want to conceal their crimes.=C2=A0

      Oh Elon
   =20
 =20
I have been away from this column for about a month, and my last columns in=
 July were more or less entirely about Elon Musk=E2=80=99s fight to walk aw=
ay from his deal to buy Twitter Inc. I have to say that I don=E2=80=99t fee=
l like I=E2=80=99ve missed much? Since my   last column, Musk filed his  an=
swer and counterclaims to Twitter=E2=80=99s lawsuit, but there=E2=80=99s no=
thing really new there. Musk=E2=80=99s defense is still that (1) Twitter pr=
omised him that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are bot=
s and (2) Twitter is conducting a massive long-running fraud, it has many f=
ewer users than it claims, and its executives have conspired to deceive inv=
estors and advertisers and cover up its lack of real users. Point (1) is ju=
st false =E2=80=94=C2=A0the merger agreement is public and you can read it,=
 and Musk never negotiated at all for any information about bots=C2=A0=E2=
=80=94=C2=A0and Point (2) is a=C2=A0weird conspiracy theory with absolutely=
 no evidence for it. But I have said all of this before and nothing has cha=
nged. The trial   starts on October 17 and I guess I=E2=80=99ll see you the=
n in Delaware?Meanwhile Musk continues to get up to stuff. When he tried to=
 get out of the Twitter deal,   I wrote:Elon Musk is the richest person in =
the world, and, like many other rich people, he has some unusual and expens=
ive hobbies. One of his hobbies is that he sometimes likes to pretend that =
he will acquire public companies.=C2=A0He seems to find this fun, and why n=
ot? When he pretends that he=E2=80=99ll buy a public company, it creates a =
big drama with him at the center of it. He gets to boss people around, mobi=
lize legions of bankers and lawyers and financing sources and random hanger=
s-on hoping to get the deal done, and then when he gets bored he can tell a=
ll those people to go home. =E2=80=9CHaha got you,=E2=80=9D he can say, and=
 they can all have a good laugh, or he can anyway.It is a=C2=A0weird hobby,=
 isn=E2=80=99t it? These dramas always seem to end unpleasantly for him: Wh=
en he pretended he was going to buy Tesla Inc., he ended up paying a multim=
illion-dollar fraud settlement to the SEC and having restrictions put on hi=
s Twitter use, which he then ignored. When he pretended he was going to buy=
 Twitter, he got, uh, sued for $44 billion is I guess what is going on now.=
 From the outside, this all seems bad, and you might expect him to say =E2=
=80=9Cyou know what, it isn=E2=80=99t worth it, I am going to stop pretendi=
ng to buy companies.=E2=80=9D But,   no:Elon Musk joked on Twitter about bu=
ying Manchester United Plc, letting 4 1/2 hours go by before clarifying he =
was kidding about purchasing the English football club listed on the New Yo=
rk Stock Exchange.The world=E2=80=99s richest person sent his initial missi=
ve about the storied club in a reply to an earlier post about his political=
 allegiances. When a Tesla Inc. fan account asked whether Musk was serious,=
 he replied no, he isn=E2=80=99t buying any sports teams. =E2=80=A6Musk=E2=
=80=99s Manchester United tweets could attract fresh regulatory attention, =
since the club has traded on the NYSE since 2012.He cannot stop himself fro=
m pretending to buy public companies! What if he ever wants to actually buy=
 a company? At this point, if you run a company, and Elon Musk shows up wit=
h an offer to buy your company, there=E2=80=99s like an 80% chance that he=
=E2=80=99s kidding.=C2=A0Even=C2=A0if he has bankers and lawyers and fully =
committed financing and a signed merger agreement, he=E2=80=99s probably ki=
dding. I assume that there is some sort of business-genius negotiation stra=
tegy here that I am missing, and that when he actually does want to buy a c=
ompany the board will be so terrified by his maniacal track record that the=
y=E2=80=99ll just say =E2=80=9Cfine, take it, it=E2=80=99s free, just let u=
s leave quietly.=E2=80=9D[5]Elsewhere, =E2=80=9CTesla has had   at least fo=

      What is Martin Shkreli up to?
   =20
 =20
The purest form of meme-stock investing has been enabled by cryptocurrency.=
 In the olden days, before he went to prison, if you wanted to invest in =
=E2=80=9Chey, Martin Shkreli does funny stuff, I like that, let me put $100=
 into that,=E2=80=9D you=E2=80=99d have to buy shares in his biotech compan=
y. And that stock would go up and down partly based on Martin Shkreli=E2=80=
=99s ability to attract attention to himself but also partly based on, you =
know, its actual business results. But now Shkreli is   banned from running=
 public companies. Instead, he has =E2=80=9CDruglike, a Web3 drug discovery=
 software platform,=E2=80=9D=C2=A0with a token called =E2=80=9CMartin Shkre=
li Inu,=E2=80=9D and if you want to invest in his general attention-seeking=
 ability that seems like a good pure play.   Though of course:Martin Shkrel=
i Inu, a token worth fractions of a penny that was launched by the notoriou=
s =E2=80=9CPharma Bro=E2=80=9D last month, plunged more than 90% at one poi=
nt [August 12], Binance data shows. The drop came after an unidentified wal=
let that appears to belong to Shkreli sold a massive stake in the coin.=C2=
=A0Asked about the plunge on the social media site Discord, an account beli=
eved to be run by Shrkeli responded: =E2=80=9CI got hacked.=E2=80=9D A repr=
esentative for Shkreli declined to comment.A series of blockchain transacti=
ons show a crypto wallet account named 0xshkreli.eth transfer more than 160=
 billion tokens to an unidentified wallet early Friday, according to Ethers=
can, which tracks blockchain transactions.Yeah I mean if you bought Martin =
Shkreli Inu tokens and Martin Shkreli rug-pulled you (or,=C2=A0even better,=
 if he  got hacked while trying to download porn, as he is apparently claim=
ing,=C2=A0and the hacker rug-pulled you), that seems about right. Crypto ha=
s created a way to tokenize and trade the aesthetic experience of getting s=
cammed by Martin Shkreli, and the people who bought it got exactly what the=
y paid for.

d cash flow analysis,[1] and stocks became (again) a way to bet on the futu=
re profits of productive enterprises. If you wanted to analyze a stock, you=
=E2=80=99d analyze its operations and build a spreadsheet and predict its f=
uture financial results and do some math to those results to get a current =
value. If the value was higher than the price, you=E2=80=99d buy the stock.=
 There were reasons that this approach became dominant. The crash of 1929 a=
nd the ensuing depression meant that the mood was=C2=A0<em>bad</em>, so inv=
esting in productive businesses was relatively more attractive than betting=
 on mass enthusiasm. The creation of the modern US system of securities reg=
ulation in the 1930s meant that stock manipulation was=C2=A0harder to do, w=
hile getting financial information about companies was easier: You actually=
=C2=A0<em>could=C2=A0</em>analyze cash flows. But, also, doing math to sobe=
r business analyses just seems more=C2=A0<em>professional</em>. If investin=
g is a game of mass psychology and gambling, then it is not quite respectab=
le=C2=A0to make your living from it. If investing is a business of building=
 complex quantitative models to allocate capital to its best uses, then it =
is much more reputable and impressive, and you can hire lots of Harvard app=

volatility in its stock price to offer bondholders a deal that would lighte=

 company</a> outlining the proposal. In one sense it=E2=80=99s a fairly str=

y with bonds trading at 20 to 40 cents on the dollar,[2] then you can try t=
o buy those bonds back for 30 to 50 cents=E2=80=99 worth of new bonds, givi=
ng=C2=A0you=C2=A0less debt and your bondholders a nice profit. In another s=
ense, it is a complicated way to say =E2=80=9Clook, you are a meme stock, w=
hich means that investors want to YOLO your call options, so what you shoul=
d do is create some call options and sell them to pay off your debt.=E2=80=
=9D Warrants and convertibles are company-issued call options, and call opt=
ions are the meme-iest way to trade meme stocks.</p><p style=3D"margin: 16p=

=C2=A0</em>to give to a meme-stock issuer is: Every Monday, if your stock i=
s trading at $10, sell a bunch of warrants with a $20 strike price expiring=
 on Friday, for say $1 each.=C2=A0If your stock doubles, you sold stock at =
$20, which is a lot better than you expected. If, much more likely, your st=

=A0they are buying short-dated listed call options anyway =E2=80=94=C2=A0so=
 you might as well let them overpay <em>you</em>. In practice this is trick=
y: It=C2=A0seems weird to do=C2=A0<em>one-week=C2=A0</em>warrants, and anyw=
ay a warrant isn=E2=80=99t quite the same thing as a weekly listed call opt=
ion.=C2=A0(In fact warrants on meme-y stocks seem much=C2=A0<em>less=C2=A0<=

ts, which just led to more and more fear of missing out,=E2=80=9D he said.<=
/p><p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">At the start of last week, the shares climb=

i style=3D"margin-bottom: 5px;">An ESG investor might look at environmental=
, social and governance factors to evaluate the financial prospects and ris=
ks of an investment. If sea levels rise, this coastal-hotels business might=
 be in trouble; if the world gets serious about combatting climate change a=
nd so imposes restrictions on carbon emissions, this coal-mining business m=
ight not be able to sell its coal. These are financial risks like any other=
, and should inform investment decisions.</li>=09<li style=3D"margin-bottom=
: 5px;">A big diversified investor that owns lots of shares of lots of comp=
anies will spend most of her time thinking about systematic risks, because =
she has diversified away idiosyncratic risk. Climate change or social uphea=
val might be bad for all of her companies, so when she talks to the manager=
s of her companies she will spend less time telling them how to optimize th=
eir widget factories and more time asking them about global warming.</li>=
=09<li style=3D"margin-bottom: 5px;">An investor who wants, not just to mak=
e money for herself, but also to make the world better, might try to do tha=
t through her investing. (By buying stocks of good companies and avoiding s=
tocks of evil companies, or by buying stocks of evil companies and lobbying=
 them to stop doing evil things, or something else.)</li>=09<li style=3D"ma=
rgin-bottom: 5px;">An asset manager who wants to make a lot of money might =
change the name of the XYZ Large-Cap Fund to the XYZ ESG Fund, without maki=
ng many other changes, because (1) lots of investors want ESG funds, (2) th=

u can charge=C2=A0higher fees for=C2=A0ESG funds.</li></ol><p style=3D"marg=

nsist too much on any distinctions between these things. If your clients va=
guely assume that you are=C2=A0<em>both=C2=A0</em>maximizing their returns =
by being thoughtful about systemic risks,=C2=A0<em>and=C2=A0</em>making the=

 in some tension. In particular, not everyone agrees on what will make the =
world better, and ESG-investing-as-environmental-activism has become politi=
cally controversial and might no longer be good advertising. But ESG-invest=
ing-as-a-way-to-look-at-systematic-risks remains important. If you are a bi=
g systematic investor and you genuinely think that no one will use coal in =
10 years, then you probably won=E2=80=99t want to fund a coal mine. But you=

plaint, filed in the Northern District of Georgia, states that Equifax enga=
ged a Chicago-based public relations firm in August 2017 to assist with han=
dling the inquiries expected to be generated by the announcement of the int=
rusion and breach. According to the complaint, Ann M. Dishinger, who worked=
 as a finance manager at the public relations firm, learned about the Equif=
ax breach through her position and tipped her significant other, Lawrence M=
. Palmer (L. Palmer), with the nonpublic news. The SEC alleges that L. Palm=
er then contacted a former business client and arranged for the client to p=
urchase out-of-the-money Equifax put options in the client's brokerage acco=
unt with the understanding that the client and L. Palmer would split any tr=
