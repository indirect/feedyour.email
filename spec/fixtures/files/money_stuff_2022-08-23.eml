My basic meme-stock corporate finance advice is that, if you are a public c=
ompany, and people want to pay a lot of money for your stock for no real re=
ason, you should sell it to them.
  [1]
=C2=A0If your stock is overpriced, you should sell it. This is good for you=
r existing shareholders, because you are selling shares for more than they =
are worth, which is accretive. It is bad for the people=C2=A0buying=C2=A0th=
e shares from you, because they are overpaying, but on the other hand=C2=A0=
they were going to buy=C2=A0the shares anyway from someone else on the stoc=
k exchange, so they=C2=A0might as well buy them from you instead.
While this feels right as basic high-level advice, there are some complicat=
ions that can make it tricky. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, fo=
r instance, doesn=E2=80=99t love meme-stock issuers taking advantage of dum=
b prices to sell stock, so if you=E2=80=99re going to do it   you have to w=
arn potential buyers that the price is dumb. (This is not much of an impedi=
ment; the buyers don=E2=80=99t care.) In egregious cases =E2=80=94=C2=A0if =
for instance you are=C2=A0actually in bankruptcy=C2=A0=E2=80=94=C2=A0the SE=
C   won=E2=80=99t let you do it at all.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is a huge meme stock and has, over the last=
 couple of years, been particularly aggressive about selling stock into its=
 meme rally. In June 2020, AMC had about  104 million=C2=A0shares=C2=A0of s=
tock outstanding; now it has about  516 million. Roughly 80% of all AMC sha=
res were issued in the last two years, partly out of late-2020 desperation =
(a pandemic is bad for movie theaters) but partly out of early-2021 opportu=
nism (a meme-stock rally is great for movie theaters I guess?). Retail inve=
stor enthusiasm got AMC out of   some real financial difficulties.=C2=A0And=
 then it kept going. In March it  bought a gold mine? AMC, led by its meme-=
loving chief executive officer Adam Aron, has seized every opportunity prov=
ided by its legion of meme-stock retail investors to shore up its finances,=
 pivot into new businesses and become sort of a meme-stock conglomerate.
There is, however, a weird complication limiting how much AMC can do. A pub=
lic company=E2=80=99s certificate of incorporation will say how many shares=
 it can issue, and that number can=E2=80=99t be changed without a vote of t=
he majority of outstanding shares. AMC is limited to issuing  524,173,073 s=
hares of common stock. It has issued 516,820,595 of those shares, leaving a=
bout 7.4 million to spare, though some of those might be reserved for emplo=
yee stock-based compensation or other uses. In round numbers, AMC is out of=
 shares to issue. So it can=E2=80=99t sell more shares to raise money, and =
it can=E2=80=99t issue more shares to, for instance, attract new employees =
or buy new gold mines.
  [2]

AMC sensibly tried to address this problem by  asking shareholders to autho=
rize 500 million new shares, but shareholders objected
  [3]
=C2=A0and AMC ultimately=C2=A0withdrew the proposal. So it is stuck with th=
e shares it has. (I   once proposed that it should issue its last available=
 share for millions of dollars, because there is a ton of meme value to own=
ing the last AMC share, but I guess I was kidding?)
On the other hand, AMC has=C2=A0preferred=C2=A0shares. Its  certificate of =
incorporation authorizes it to issue up to 50 million shares of preferred s=
tock, and like most companies it hadn=E2=80=99t issued any.
  [4]
=C2=A0As is typical for public companies, this is what is called =E2=80=9Cb=
lank-check preferred=E2=80=9D: The board of directors can decide how much t=
o issue, what its rights are, how much to sell it for, etc., without shareh=
older approval. This is a pretty significant loophole. What the board can d=
o is issue preferred stock that=C2=A0looks like=C2=A0common stock. Specific=
ally:
=09The preferred stock can have the same voting rights as the common stock.=
=09The preferred stock can have the same economic rights as the common stoc=
k: If AMC pays a cash dividend on the common, the preferred gets the same d=
ividend; if AMC is acquired in a merger, the preferred gets paid the same p=
rice as the common, etc.=09The preferred stock can be=C2=A0convertible=C2=
=A0into the common stock, if AMC=E2=80=99s shareholders ever approve enough=
 shares.

Technically you have to deal with the 50-million-share cap=C2=A0on preferre=
d shares, but that can be managed: You can say =E2=80=9Ceach preferred shar=
e is equivalent to 100 shares of common stock,=E2=80=9D giving you 5 billio=
n share equivalents to play with. Then you can set up a depository receipt =
program where AMC issues shares of the preferred stock to a depository, and=
 the depository issues receipts for 1/100th of a preferred share to investo=
rs. Then each receipt should be economically equivalent to one common share=
.
This all sounds weird, when I write it down like that.=C2=A0But it is actua=
lly a pretty well-known technology, in the niche world of companies without=
 enough authorized shares.
  [5]
=C2=A0Surely lots of bankers and lawyers pitched it to AMC. Yesterday   AMC=
 did it:

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.=E2=80=99s preferred stock made its debut Mo=
nday amid a selloff in other meme stocks and the broader market, making for=
 a volatile day. ...
AMC issued a dividend after Friday=E2=80=99s close of one preferred equity =
unit for each share of the common, in effect putting in place a 2-for-1 sto=
ck split. The preferred shares traded for the first time Monday on the New =
York Stock Exchange under the =E2=80=9CAPE=E2=80=9D symbol, a term Reddit u=
sers coined to refer to others who are bullish on so-called meme stocks. Th=
e split sparked some volatile trading, triggering multiple trading halts in=
 earlier trading Monday for both classes of shares.

Specifically, the trade was to (1)=C2=A0authorize=C2=A01 billion new APE un=
its, each of which is equivalent to one common share and (2)=C2=A0issue=C2=
=A0about 516.8 million of them to holders of existing AMC common shares as =
a dividend. So if you owned an AMC common share on Friday, on Monday you ow=
ned an AMC common share=C2=A0plus=C2=A0an APE unit. That is =E2=80=9Cin eff=
ect=E2=80=9D a 2-for-1 stock split: Each APE unit has the same economic and=
 voting rights as a common share, so you went from owning one common share =
to owning two-ish common-ish shares.
  [6]
=C2=A0
In practice, this is all a bit strange, and the APE units trade at a discou=
nt. AMC=E2=80=99s common stock closed at $10.46 yesterday; the APEs closed =
at $6.00. (AMC closed at $18.02 on Friday, before the split, so the total p=
ackage was down about 8.7%.) As of 11 a.m. today the APEs were up (to about=
 $6.53) and the AMCs were down (to about $9.91), and you might expect to se=
e a certain amount of convergence if AMC=E2=80=99s shareholders agree=C2=A0=
that the APEs are equivalent to the common stock.
  [7]

But the point isn=E2=80=99t really the stock split. The point is that now A=
MC has 483 million APE units that it hasn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0issued. At yesterd=
ay=E2=80=99s APE closing price, that=E2=80=99s $2.9 billion worth of stock =
to play with.
  [8]
=C2=A0In its  Frequently Asked Questions about the APE dividend, AMC does s=
ome foreshadowing:

Authorized but unissued AMC Preferred Equity units can be issued in the fut=
ure in the same way that AMC can issue authorized but unissued shares of co=
mmon stock. Normal regulations and requirements with respect to share issua=
nces apply, including potential filings with the SEC and public disclosure,=
 along with the circumstances under which shareholder approval is or is not=
 required.
AMC Preferred Equity units provide AMC with a currency that can be used in =
the future to further strengthen our balance sheet, including by reducing o=
ur debt and other liabilities. The AMC Preferred Equity units also give AMC=
 the ability to invest in shareholder value-enhancing and transformative M&=
A investment opportunities. In addition, the flexibility provided by the Co=
mpany=E2=80=99s AMC Preferred Equity units immensely lessens any survival r=
isk as we continue to work our way through the impact of the COVID pandemic=
 towards recovery and transformation.

If you are a company with a meme stock, you should sell stock. If you run o=
ut of stock to sell, you should create more, and then sell it.
A few other points. First, the ordinary approach with this sort of thing wo=
uld be to try to convert the APEs into AMC common shares as soon as possibl=
e. AMC has in the past tried to get shareholder approval to issue new share=
s, but it has been rebuffed. Now, though, it has a fait accompli: It can go=
 to shareholders and say =E2=80=9Clook, these APEs are already trading, but=
 they are trading at a discount in annoying ways, so you might as well give=
 us permission to issue more common shares so we can go back to having a si=
ngle share class.=E2=80=9D Maybe that will work.
  [9]

But AMC doesn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0have=C2=A0to do that, and it has no immediate =
plans to. From the FAQ:

Technically yes, the AMC Preferred Equity units can convert into common sto=
ck, but only if the AMC Board proposes and then investors vote to approve a=
n increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock, in an amount=
 at least sufficient to permit the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity u=
nits into common stock.
However, we do not currently expect the AMC Board to make such a proposal a=
ny time soon.
It is more likely than not that the two securities, the common stock and AM=
C Preferred Equity units will trade as two separate securities for quite so=
me time to come.

AMC is a meme stock, and APE is =E2=80=94=C2=A0potentially =E2=80=94=C2=A0a=
 very meme-y security indeed. Why not see what happens? Maybe AMC can extra=
ct=C2=A0more=C2=A0value from APE by leaving it as its own separate class of=
 stock. The business of being a meme stock is largely about=C2=A0getting at=
tention, and having a weird APE unit might be more attention-getting than h=
aving one class of stock would.
Second, is there an AMC/APE arbitrage trade? You might take a view like: =
=E2=80=9CAPE shares have the same economic and voting rights as AMC common =
shares, and will eventually be convertible into common shares, but they tra=
de at a big discount. I should short AMC shares, buy the same number of APE=
 shares, and profit when the gap closes.=E2=80=9D Good luck to you with tha=
t one! I will not comment on it as a thesis except to say that AMC=E2=80=99=
s retail shareholders seem to be endlessly angry about short sellers, so if=
 you short AMC stock as part of an arbitrage trade they will probably be en=
dlessly angry at you.
  [10]

Third, speaking of being endlessly angry at short sellers: One tactic that =
we have talked about from time to time around here is that=C2=A0a company w=
ith a lot of short sellers can issue an inconvenient weird dividend to make=
 life difficult for the short sellers. The way short selling works is that,=
 to short stock, you have to borrow it, and when you return it you have to =
give your lender back whatever they would have gotten from holding the stoc=
k. So if a stock pays a $1 cash dividend, then short sellers need to pay $1=
 to their share lenders. If a stock does a 2-for-1 split, short sellers nee=
d to return twice as many shares as they borrowed to close out their shorts=
.
And if a stock pays a dividend of, say, seven magic beans per share, then t=
he short sellers need to go out and find seven magic beans to deliver to th=
eir share lenders.=C2=A0For instance, in 2019, Overstock.com Inc. tried to =
do a special dividend of preferred stock that traded only on its own blockc=
hain platform, and that was not tradeable at all for six months. A short se=
ller would need to go buy shares of that stock to deliver to her share lend=
ers, but she couldn=E2=80=99t, because it didn=E2=80=99t trade. =E2=80=9CAh=
a, got you,=E2=80=9D Overstock more or less cackled, and=C2=A0the shorts we=
re squeezed, though eventually this plan collapsed under the weight of   ge=
neral Overstock insanity.
This is not that at all! APE trades liquidly on the New York Stock Exchange=
, this is more or less a stock split, and it will be very easy for short se=
llers to deliver APE to their lenders. Instead of buying back a share of AM=
C, they=E2=80=99ll just have to buy back a share of AMC plus an APE unit. A=
n AMC share plus an APE unit this week cost less than an AMC share did last=
 week, so this is good=C2=A0for the shorts, so far.=C2=A0Still I am mention=
ing it here because there are various incomprehensible conspiracy theories =
about AMC short sellers, =E2=80=9Cphantom shares,=E2=80=9D etc., and so it =
is just about possible to say =E2=80=9Caha, issuing an APE dividend will fl=
ush out all the phantom shares and catch the nefarious short sellers!=E2=80=
=9D I don=E2=80=99t know. Here=E2=80=99s  the Wall Street Journal:
The company has faced unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on the internet t=
hat there are millions of synthetic AMC shares in circulation, as well as d=
emands from some investor personalities on social media for a share recount=
. By issuing one Ape unit for each existing common share, AMC is hoping to =
put those theories to rest, because only holders of legitimate shares would=
 receive units, the person said.
And Adam Aron is a sensible guy but he knows his audience; here  he is on T=
witter a few weeks ago:

      Oh Twitter

The situation is that the richest person in the world, Elon Musk, has $44 b=
illion riding on the question of whether Twitter Inc. is doing a massive lo=
ng-running fraud on its users, its advertisers and its shareholders. Musk h=
as claimed that it is, with no evidence at all, just a vague feeling that h=
e has. If he=E2=80=99s right and there is a massive fraud, then he can get =
out of his agreement to buy Twitter for about $44 billion. If he=E2=80=99s =
wrong, he has to buy Twitter.=C2=A0
This situation is extremely well known. There are incentives. If you have s=
omething to do with Twitter, or you know something about Twitter, or you ar=
e in the business of counting Twitter bots, then you should take a few minu=
tes and ask yourself: Well, do I know anything about Twitter doing any mass=
ive frauds? If you do =E2=80=A6=C2=A0look, I don=E2=80=99t know exactly wha=
t you can do with that. I am not at all sure that you can actually go to El=
on Musk and be like =E2=80=9Chey I=E2=80=99ve got a pile of fraud documents=
, they=E2=80=99re yours for $1 billion.=E2=80=9D (He could send you a subpo=
ena and get them for free?) Even if you did strike a deal with him, he=E2=
=80=99s notoriously bad about sticking to his deals. Still. I just have a v=
ague general sense that saving the richest person in the world $44 billion =
is a good career move.=C2=A0
So you should expect that, over the next month or two,=C2=A0as Musk=E2=80=
=99s trial date with Twitter approaches, people will be popping up to say =
=E2=80=9Coh sure Twitter is a fraud, massive fraud, totally, I have proof, =
Elon, call me.=E2=80=9D Possibly some of them will have proof that Twitter =
is doing massive fraud! You never know.
Anyway  here=E2=80=99s a guy:

Twitter executives deceived federal regulators and the company=E2=80=99s ow=
n board of directors about =E2=80=9Cextreme, egregious deficiencies=E2=80=
=9D in its defenses against hackers, as well as its meager efforts to fight=
 spam, according to an explosive whistleblower complaint from its former se=
curity chief.
The complaint from former head of security Peiter Zatko, a widely admired h=
acker known as =E2=80=9CMudge,=E2=80=9D depicts Twitter as a chaotic and ru=
dderless company beset by infighting, unable to properly protect its 238 mi=
llion daily users including government agencies, heads of state and other i=
nfluential public figures. =E2=80=A6
=E2=80=9CSecurity and privacy have long been top companywide priorities at =
Twitter,=E2=80=9D said Twitter spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn. She said that Zatk=
o=E2=80=99s allegations appeared to be =E2=80=9Criddled with inaccuracies=
=E2=80=9D and that Zatko =E2=80=9Cnow appears to be opportunistically seeki=
ng to inflict harm on Twitter, its customers, and its shareholders.=E2=80=
=9D Hahn said that Twitter fired Zatko after 15 months =E2=80=9Cfor poor pe=
rformance and leadership.=E2=80=9D ...
A person familiar with Zatko=E2=80=99s tenure said the company investigated=
 Zatko=E2=80=99s security claims during his time there and concluded they w=
ere sensationalistic and without merit.

The Washington Post article quoted above includes a copy of Zatko=E2=80=99s=
 redacted complaint. =E2=80=9CPlease note,=E2=80=9D says a footnote, =E2=80=
=9Cthat Mudge began preparing these disclosures in early March 2022, well b=
efore Mr. Musk expressed any interest in acquiring Twitter, and has not com=
municated these disclosures to anyone with a financial interest in Twitter.=
=E2=80=9D
And, to be clear, Zatko=E2=80=99s complaint doesn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0agree with=
 Musk=E2=80=99s. The   narrow issue in the Musk/Twitter dispute=C2=A0is whe=
ther Twitter has been=C2=A0lying in its securities filings when it says tha=
t it estimates that fewer than 5% of its =E2=80=9Cmonetizable daily active =
users=E2=80=9D are spam or bot accounts. And Zatko is pretty unambiguous th=
at, no, Twitter=E2=80=99s numbers are correct. His lawyers write:

Executives are incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU, because mD=
AU is reported to advertisers, and advertisers use it to calculate the effe=
ctiveness of ads. If mDAU includes spam bots that do not click through ads =
to buy products, then advertisers conclude the ads are less effective, and =
might shift their ad spending away from Twitter to other platforms with hig=
her perceived effectiveness.
However, there are many millions of active accounts that are=C2=A0not=C2=A0=
considered =E2=80=9CmDAU,=E2=80=9D either because they are spam bots, or be=
cause Twitter does not believe it can monetize them. These millions of non-=
mDAU accounts are part of the median user=E2=80=99s experience on the platf=
orm.

Musk=E2=80=99s claim is that Twitter counts spam bots in its mDAU numbers. =
Zatko=E2=80=99s complaint says, no, obviously Twitter doesn=E2=80=99t do th=
at =E2=80=94=C2=A0that=E2=80=99s just a thing that Musk made up to get out =
of the deal =E2=80=94=C2=A0but the spam bots=C2=A0exist=C2=A0and are annoyi=
ng. Twitter does a good job of excluding them from its count of monetizable=
 users, he says, but not of getting rid of them entirely. That=E2=80=99s no=
t fraud; it=E2=80=99s just a thing that annoys Zatko (and Musk).=C2=A0
The rest of the complaint is mostly like that too. The gist of it is that, =
when he worked there, Zatko felt like Twitter was disorganized and incompet=
ent, and because Twitter is a really important platform with lots of users,=
 that=E2=80=99s bad. =E2=80=9CMudge Discovers Egregious Deficiencies, Negli=
gence, Willful Ignorance, and Threats to National Security & Democracy=E2=
=80=9D is one representative section header. Basically =E2=80=9CTwitter was=
 bad at running a website.=E2=80=9D Which I think a lot of people already b=
elieved?
But if you believe Zatko=E2=80=99s claims, you could spin some legal argume=
nts from them. (Ann Lipton has  a good Twitter thread analyzing what Zatko=
=E2=80=99s claims could mean for Musk.) If Twitter was bad at safeguarding =
user data, did that violate the law (including in particular its  2011 sett=
lement with the Federal Trade Commission over user data)? Were Twitter=E2=
=80=99s securities filings misleading, because they didn=E2=80=99t disclose=
 all of its security vulnerabilities? When all this stuff comes out, will t=
hat cause a =E2=80=9Cmaterial adverse effect=E2=80=9D on Twitter=E2=80=99s =
business, which will let Musk get out of the deal? Meh, I don=E2=80=99t kno=
w.=C2=A0
Even if=C2=A0these claims are true, and even if they are evidence of fraud =
or=C2=A0material adverse effect, they are=C2=A0not evidence of anything tha=
t Musk=C2=A0has been complaining about. Musk would have to, like, send Twit=
ter a new termination letter saying =E2=80=9Cnever mind about the bot stuff=
,=C2=A0now I=E2=80=99m terminating the deal because of the security vulnera=
bility stuff.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0But he could do that, why not. He=E2=80=99s not=
 limited to the excuses he=E2=80=99s already tried; if people keep finding =
him new excuses to get out of the deal, he can try those too. Maybe one wil=
l work.

      Pump-hack-and-dump
   =20
 =20

The basic=C2=A0mechanics of=C2=A0a pump-and-dump scam are that you acquire =
a bunch of some penny stock for very little money (by buying it in the open=
 market, or more often by being an insider of the penny-stock company), and=
 then you trick naive public investors into buying the stock from you for m=
ore money. There are some pretty well-known traditional=C2=A0methods for tr=
icking the public:
=09Especially if you control the company, you go around issuing press relea=
ses about how the company has found a cure for cancer or is pivoting to the=
 blockchain or whatever. Retail investors are fooled and buy the stock.=09E=
ven if you don=E2=80=99t control the company, you put out a fake press rele=
ase saying that Tesla Inc. has offered to buy the company, and then dump yo=
ur stock quickly while the market is fooled.=09You sell some stock to your =
friend for $0.02, she sells it back to you for $0.03, you sell it back to h=
er for $0.04, she sells it back to you for $0.05, you post on some message =
boards saying =E2=80=9CTHIS STOCK IS SOARING, LOOK AT THIS PRICE ACTION,=E2=
=80=9D and then you sell to the readers of those message-board posts for $0=
.06 and split the profits with your friend.=09You post on a message board s=
aying =E2=80=9Chey I=E2=80=99m gonna pump this stock=E2=80=9D and other peo=
ple say =E2=80=9Csure all right sounds fun.=E2=80=9D They=C2=A0buy the stoc=
k=C2=A0as part of a conscious game of musical chairs:=C2=A0Someone=C2=A0wil=
l be left holding the bag, overpaying for worthless stock and unable to sel=
l before it collapses, but everyone has fun playing the game and trying to =
get out in time.

There might be a few others, and you can combine these approaches. They are=
 all a bit clich=C3=A9d at this point, and I always wonder how much capacit=
y they could possibly have.=C2=A0(Who is the audience for all these fake pr=
ess releases?) But it is still a thriving business, and there is still inno=
vation. For instance, here is a US Securities and Exchange Commission enfor=
cement action from last week:

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 18 individuals and ent=
ities for their roles in a fraudulent scheme in which dozens of online reta=
il brokerage accounts were hacked and improperly used to purchase microcap =
stocks to manipulate the price and trading volume of those stocks. ...
According to the SEC=E2=80=99s complaint, in late 2017 and early 2018, hack=
ers accessed at least 31 U.S. retail brokerage accounts and used them to pu=
rchase the securities of Lotus Bio-Technology Development Corp. and Good Ga=
ming, Inc. The unauthorized purchases allegedly enabled fraudsters, who alr=
eady controlled large blocks of Lotus Bio-Tech and Good Gaming stock, to se=
ll their holdings at artificially high prices and reap more than $1 million=
 in illicit proceeds.

Sure? If you can just hack into a bunch of brokerage accounts and turn them=
 into zombies to buy your penny stocks, you don=E2=80=99t even need to both=
er with fake press releases. Very efficient.

      Hologram crypto fraud
   =20
 =20

The basic form of cryptocurrency fraud is that you send a venture capitalis=
t a Twitter direct message saying =E2=80=9Chi can you send me the password =
to your NFT wallet=E2=80=9D and he replies =E2=80=9Csure, here you go!=E2=
=80=9D and you take all of his non-fungible tokens. On the other hand I gue=
ss there are  more baroque approaches:
A set of hackers managed to impersonate Binance chief communications office=
r (CCO) Patrick Hillmann in a series of video calls with several representa=
tives of cryptocurrency projects. The attackers used what Hillman described=
 as an AI hologram, a deepfake of his image for this objective, and managed=
 to fool some representatives of these projects, making them think Hillmann=
 was helping them get listed on the exchange.
I=E2=80=99m not sure I even understand why that would be valuable (did holo=
gram Hillmann ask these projects to pay for those fake listings?) but, sure=
, hologram crypto fraud.

It=E2=80=99s been a while  but here=E2=80=99s this again:=C2=A0

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is already trading some bonds and other debt secur=
ities for clients on blockchain-based networks such as Ethereum, and the ba=
nk is building its own blockchain-based trading platform. JPMorgan Chase & =
Co. already has a platform in place, called Onyx.
Big Wall Street firms help make the economy run, connecting buyers and sell=
ers of securities and lending money to businesses. But their sophisticated =
trades are often run on creaky old systems. Goldman and others hope they wi=
ll be able to run faster, less-costly and ultimately more-profitable system=
s based on blockchains. =E2=80=A6
=E2=80=9CBlockchain technology is going to rewire all financial services,=
=E2=80=9D said Tom Farley, the former president of the New York Stock Excha=
nge.
That said, Wall Street firms have been experimenting with blockchain projec=
ts for at least the past five years. Despite much hype, few have had a wide=
spread impact on how financial transactions take place.

In 2017, when we talked about this a lot, my view was that saying =E2=80=9C=
blockchain blockchain blockchain!=E2=80=9D was a way to get the chief execu=
tive officer of your bank excited about a=C2=A0project to upgrade trading s=
ystems and databases. Apparently not=C2=A0that=C2=A0excited. Excited enough=
 to get around to it in 2022.

      The deli closed
   =20
 =20

Huh, there you go:

The small, money-losing New Jersey deli that was once the sole asset of a p=
ublicly traded company with a bizarre market capitalization of $100 million=
 has been sold and closed, according to a regulatory filing.
Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, had been =E2=80=9Ctemporarily =
closed=E2=80=9D on June 19 while its management sought a new buyer, Makamer=
 Holdings said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On July 1, Makamer sold the deli=E2=80=99s remaining inventory for $700. An=
d then on Aug. 9, the company =E2=80=9Cdisposed of its subsidiary Your Home=
town Deli, LLC for a price of $15,000, consisting of $5,000 to be paid in c=
ash and a $10,000 note receivable,=E2=80=9D the filing said.
Makamer, a bioplastics startup, merged with the deli=E2=80=99s owner, Homet=
own International, earlier this year.
=E2=80=9CAfter carefully evaluating its prospects, the Company=E2=80=99s ne=
w management has determined to sell Your Hometown Deli and its assets and f=
ocus on the business operations of Makamer as the Company=E2=80=99s busines=
s going forward,=E2=80=9D the regulatory filing said.

We  talked about the  deli a  lot last  year. Now it is a bioplastics compa=
ny. The consensus around the deli was that it was not=C2=A0really=C2=A0a $1=
00 million publicly traded deli: It was a shell company that would eventual=
ly be used to take some other weird company public, and the deli was just s=
ort of a placeholder. That all happened pretty much as expected.

  [1] I also   occasionally dabble in more complicated meme-stock corporate=
 finance advice about, like, selling volatility or whatever. But =E2=80=9Ci=
f people want to overpay for your stock, sell it to them=E2=80=9D is the *b=
asic* advice.


  [2] Would it want to? One rough analysis of a meme stock is that retail i=
nvestors enthusiastically buy it at prices disconnected from fundamentals. =
But if you are trying to, say,   lure Amazon executives to senior leadershi=
p roles at your meme-stock company, they might *not* want to be paid in mem=
e stock. They might think it is overvalued. Arguably people who want to be =
paid in meme stock are not the people you want to hire? I could see the arg=
ument the other way. Meanwhile owners of small gold mining companies might =
want to be paid in meme stock, who knows. But surely the *main* use of meme=
 stock, for the issuer, is selling it for cash to retail investors in at-th=
e-market offerings. That=E2=80=99s where you get the most bang for your mem=
e buck.


  [3] Why? I don=E2=80=99t know. It is conventional to say that shareholder=
s don=E2=80=99t want to be diluted, and I guess that is right, but it=E2=80=
=99s kind of weird: If the stock is soaring for no reason, it is accretive =
for existing shareholders to issue more stock. (I suppose if you=E2=80=99re=
 an existing shareholder you might disagree that the stock is soaring for n=
o reason?) The other thing that is going on here is that this amendment req=
uires approval of a majority of the *outstanding shares*, so any shares tha=
t don=E2=80=99t vote are effectively counted as votes against the amendment=
. AMC stock is mostly held by retail investors, and it is widely assumed th=
at retail shareholders mostly don=E2=80=99t vote their stock. And in fact i=
f you look at the results of AMC=E2=80=99s shareholder voting this year =E2=
=80=94 on routine matters like electing directors and approving executive p=
ay =E2=80=94 only about 145 million shares (out of 516 million) were actual=
ly voted. So it might just be impossible for AMC to get a majority of its s=
hares to vote for *anything*.


  [4] There are also 75.8 million authorized shares of Class B common stock=
, none of which are outstanding: They were owned by Dalian Wanda Group Co.,=
 which converted and sold them in May 2021. I suppose AMC could re-use thos=
e shares, but they have super-voting rights so that is not really ideal.


  [5] When I was an investment banker, I advised companies on issuing conve=
rtible bonds and other equity derivatives. Surprisingly often =E2=80=94 not=
 a lot, but more than once =E2=80=94 we would run into companies without en=
ough authorized shares to fully convert their convertibles. =E2=80=9CHave t=
hem convert into common-equivalent preferred stock, then get shareholder ap=
proval for more shares=E2=80=9D was kind of the go-to advice there, sometim=
es with a penalty interest rate on the preferred (or the convertibles) if y=
ou don=E2=80=99t get the shareholder approval soon enough. This is not a th=
ing that companies do every day, but in the world of arcane equity financin=
g it is not *that* arcane.


  [6] The legal terms of the APE units are in the certificate of designatio=
ns for the preferred stock and the deposit agreement for the units. Here ar=
e the Aug. 4  press release announcing the APEs, and the  Form 8-K with mor=
e details.


  [7] Often when a company has two share classes, one will trade at a premi=
um for liquidity reasons. Intuitively you might expect a common stock to be=
 more normal and more liquid than a weird preferred stock: If someone wakes=
 up one day and says =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d like to buy AMC,=E2=80=9D they=E2=
=80=99ll buy AMC common, not APEs. And so the APEs trade at a discount. But=
 the APEs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, just like the common s=
tock, and they have a fun name and a fun ticker and a lot of hype, so you n=
ever know. Yesterday about 151 million AMC shares traded, versus about 123 =
million APEs, so it=E2=80=99s not that far off.


  [8] As a corporate finance matter I would never, ever, ever want to go ar=
ound saying that a company=E2=80=99s authorized but unissued stock is =E2=
=80=9Cworth=E2=80=9D the market price times the number of unissued shares. =
It does not work that way at all! If a company issued hundreds of millions =
more shares, the price would go down. Still in the limited meme-y case of A=
MC, where they had tons of demand for their stock and no supply, creating s=
upply does seem like it could lead straightforwardly to selling that supply=
 for money.


  [9] But probably it won=E2=80=99t =E2=80=94 see footnote 3.


  [10] Incidentally  AMC=E2=80=99s FAQ says, about shorting the APEs: =E2=
=80=9CShort selling is legal in the United States and permitted by the New =
York Stock Exchange. Therefore, AMC Preferred Equity units can be sold shor=
t in the same way that other equity securities on the NYSE can be sold shor=
t, and there is no action that AMC can take to prevent short selling.=E2=80=
=9D I suppose you could take the other side of the trade in the text =E2=80=
=94 go long AMC and short APE =E2=80=94 as a bet that they will *diverge*, =
that APE will go to zero while AMC rallies. I dunno.

</a>=C2=A0As is typical for public companies, this is what is called =E2=80=
=9Cblank-check preferred=E2=80=9D: The board of directors can decide how mu=

areholder approval. This is a pretty significant loophole. What the board c=
an do is issue preferred stock that=C2=A0<em>looks like=C2=A0</em>common st=

<blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.=E2=80=99s pref=
erred stock made its debut Monday amid a selloff in other meme stocks and t=
he broader market, making for a volatile day. ...</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">AMC issued a dividend after Friday=E2=80=99s c=
lose of one preferred equity unit for each share of the common, in effect p=
utting in place a 2-for-1 stock split. The preferred shares traded for the =
first time Monday on the New York Stock Exchange under the =E2=80=9CAPE=E2=
=80=9D symbol, a term Reddit users coined to refer to others who are bullis=
h on so-called meme stocks. The split sparked some volatile trading, trigge=
ring multiple trading halts in earlier trading Monday for both classes of s=
hares.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Specifically, the trade was to (1)=C2=A0<em>au=
thorize=C2=A0</em>1 billion new APE units, each of which is equivalent to o=
ne common share and (2)=C2=A0<em>issue=C2=A0</em>about 516.8 million of the=
m to holders of existing AMC common shares as a dividend. So if you owned a=
n AMC common share on Friday, on Monday you owned an AMC common share=C2=A0=
<em>plus=C2=A0</em>an APE unit. That is =E2=80=9Cin effect=E2=80=9D a 2-for=
-1 stock split: Each APE unit has the same economic and voting rights as a =
common share, so you went from owning one common share to owning two-ish co=
mmon-ish shares.<a class=3D"footnote-index" href=3D"#footnote-6" style=3D"c=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">In practice, this is all a bit strange, and th=
e APE units trade at a discount. AMC=E2=80=99s common stock closed at $10.4=
6 yesterday; the APEs closed at $6.00. (AMC closed at $18.02 on Friday, bef=
ore the split, so the total package was down about 8.7%.) As of 11 a.m. tod=
ay the APEs were up (to about $6.53) and the AMCs were down (to about $9.91=
), and you might expect to see a certain amount of convergence if AMC=E2=80=

lid; background-color: #ccc;"> Frequently Asked Questions</a> about the APE=
 dividend, AMC does some foreshadowing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Authorized but unissued AMC Preferred Equity u=
nits can be issued in the future in the same way that AMC can issue authori=
zed but unissued shares of common stock. Normal regulations and requirement=
s with respect to share issuances apply, including potential filings with t=
he SEC and public disclosure, along with the circumstances under which shar=
eholder approval is or is not required.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">AMC Preferred Equity units provide AMC with a =
currency that can be used in the future to further strengthen our balance s=
heet, including by reducing our debt and other liabilities. The AMC Preferr=
ed Equity units also give AMC the ability to invest in shareholder value-en=
hancing and transformative M&amp;A investment opportunities. In addition, t=
he flexibility provided by the Company=E2=80=99s AMC Preferred Equity units=
 immensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through=
 the impact of the COVID pandemic towards recovery and transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">If you are a company with a meme stock, you sh=
ould sell stock. If you run out of stock to sell, you should create more, a=
nd then sell it.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">A few other points. First, the ordinary approa=
ch with this sort of thing would be to try to convert the APEs into AMC com=
mon shares as soon as possible. AMC has in the past tried to get shareholde=
r approval to issue new shares, but it has been rebuffed. Now, though, it h=
as a fait accompli: It can go to shareholders and say =E2=80=9Clook, these =
APEs are already trading, but they are trading at a discount in annoying wa=
ys, so you might as well give us permission to issue more common shares so =
we can go back to having a single share class.=E2=80=9D Maybe that will wor=
k.<a class=3D"footnote-index" href=3D"#footnote-9" style=3D"color: #000000;=
 text-decoration: none !important; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-=

nsparent !important; display: inline-block;">
<span>[9]</span>
</a></p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">But AMC doesn=E2=80=99t=C2=A0<em>have=C2=A0</e=
m>to do that, and it has no immediate plans to. From the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Technically yes, the AMC Preferred Equity unit=
s can convert into common stock, but only if the AMC Board proposes and the=
n investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares =
of common stock, in an amount at least sufficient to permit the conversion =
of the AMC Preferred Equity units into common stock.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">However, we do not currently expect the AMC Bo=
ard to make such a proposal any time soon.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">It is more likely than not that the two securi=
ties, the common stock and AMC Preferred Equity units will trade as two sep=
arate securities for quite some time to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">AMC is a meme stock, and APE is =E2=80=94=C2=
=A0potentially =E2=80=94=C2=A0a very meme-y security indeed. Why not see wh=
at happens? Maybe AMC can extract=C2=A0<em>more=C2=A0</em>value from APE by=
 leaving it as its own separate class of stock. The business of being a mem=
e stock is largely about=C2=A0getting attention, and having a weird APE uni=
t might be more attention-getting than having one class of stock would.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Second, is there an AMC/APE arbitrage trade? Y=
ou might take a view like: =E2=80=9CAPE shares have the same economic and v=
oting rights as AMC common shares, and will eventually be convertible into =
common shares, but they trade at a big discount. I should short AMC shares,=
 buy the same number of APE shares, and profit when the gap closes.=E2=80=
=9D Good luck to you with that one! I will not comment on it as a thesis ex=
cept to say that AMC=E2=80=99s retail shareholders seem to be endlessly ang=
ry about short sellers, so if you short AMC stock as part of an arbitrage t=
rade they will probably be endlessly angry at you.<a class=3D"footnote-inde=

</a></p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Third, speaking of being endlessly angry at sh=
ort sellers: One tactic that we have talked about from time to time around =
here is that=C2=A0a company with a lot of short sellers can issue an inconv=
enient weird dividend to make life difficult for the short sellers. The way=
 short selling works is that, to short stock, you have to borrow it, and wh=
en you return it you have to give your lender back whatever they would have=
 gotten from holding the stock. So if a stock pays a $1 cash dividend, then=
 short sellers need to pay $1 to their share lenders. If a stock does a 2-f=
or-1 split, short sellers need to return twice as many shares as they borro=
wed to close out their shorts.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">And if a stock pays a dividend of, say, seven =
magic beans per share, then the short sellers need to go out and find seven=
 magic beans to deliver to their share lenders.=C2=A0For instance, in 2019,=
 Overstock.com Inc. tried to do a special dividend of preferred stock that =
traded only on its own blockchain platform, and that was not tradeable at a=
ll for six months. A short seller would need to go buy shares of that stock=
 to deliver to her share lenders, but she couldn=E2=80=99t, because it didn=
=E2=80=99t trade. =E2=80=9CAha, got you,=E2=80=9D Overstock more or less ca=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">This is not that at all! APE trades liquidly o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, this is more or less a stock split, and it w=

er Inc. is doing a massive long-running fraud on its users, its advertisers=
 and its shareholders. Musk has claimed that it is, with no evidence at all=
, just a vague feeling that he has. If he=E2=80=99s right and there is a ma=
ssive fraud, then he can get out of his agreement to buy Twitter for about =
$44 billion. If he=E2=80=99s wrong, he has to buy Twitter.=C2=A0</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">This situation is extremely well known. There =

its meager efforts to fight spam, according to an explosive whistleblower c=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The complaint from former head of security Pei=

s Twitter as a chaotic and rudderless company beset by infighting, unable t=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">=E2=80=9CSecurity and privacy have long been t=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">A person familiar with Zatko=E2=80=99s tenure =
said the company investigated Zatko=E2=80=99s security claims during his ti=

</blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The Washington Post article quoted above inclu=

he Musk/Twitter dispute=C2=A0is whether Twitter has been=C2=A0lying in its =
securities filings when it says that it estimates that fewer than 5% of its=
 =E2=80=9Cmonetizable daily active users=E2=80=9D are spam or bot accounts.=
 And Zatko is pretty unambiguous that, no, Twitter=E2=80=99s numbers are co=
rrect. His lawyers write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Executives are incentivized to avoid counting =
spam bots as mDAU, because mDAU is reported to advertisers, and advertisers=
 use it to calculate the effectiveness of ads. If mDAU includes spam bots t=
hat do not click through ads to buy products, then advertisers conclude the=
 ads are less effective, and might shift their ad spending away from Twitte=
r to other platforms with higher perceived effectiveness.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">However, there are many millions of active acc=
ounts that are=C2=A0<em>not=C2=A0</em>considered =E2=80=9CmDAU,=E2=80=9D ei=
ther because they are spam bots, or because Twitter does not believe it can=
 monetize them. These millions of non-mDAU accounts are part of the median =
user=E2=80=99s experience on the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Musk=E2=80=99s claim is that Twitter counts sp=
am bots in its mDAU numbers. Zatko=E2=80=99s complaint says, no, obviously =
Twitter doesn=E2=80=99t do <em>that</em> =E2=80=94=C2=A0that=E2=80=99s just=
 a thing that Musk made up to get out of the deal =E2=80=94=C2=A0but the sp=
am bots=C2=A0<em>exist=C2=A0</em>and are annoying. Twitter does a good job =
of excluding them from its count of monetizable users, he says, but not of =
getting rid of them entirely. That=E2=80=99s not fraud; it=E2=80=99s just a=
 thing that annoys Zatko (and Musk).=C2=A0</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">The rest of the complaint is mostly like that =
too. The gist of it is that, when he worked there, Zatko felt like Twitter =
was disorganized and incompetent, and because Twitter is a really important=
 platform with lots of users, that=E2=80=99s bad. =E2=80=9CMudge Discovers =
Egregious Deficiencies, Negligence, Willful Ignorance, and Threats to Natio=

 Basically =E2=80=9CTwitter was bad at running a website.=E2=80=9D Which I =
think a lot of people already believed?</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">But if you believe Zatko=E2=80=99s claims, you=
 could spin some legal arguments from them. (Ann Lipton has <a href=3D"http=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">According to the SEC=E2=80=99s complaint, in l=
ate 2017 and early 2018, hackers accessed at least 31 U.S. retail brokerage=
 accounts and used them to purchase the securities of Lotus Bio-Technology =
Development Corp. and Good Gaming, Inc. The unauthorized purchases allegedl=

and reap more than $1 million in illicit proceeds.</p>

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">Sure? If you can just hack into a bunch of bro=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">[7] Often when a company has two share classes=
, one will trade at a premium for liquidity reasons. Intuitively you might =
expect a common stock to be more normal and more liquid than a weird prefer=
red stock: If someone wakes up one day and says =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d like t=
o buy AMC,=E2=80=9D they=E2=80=99ll buy AMC common, not APEs. And so the AP=
Es trade at a discount. But the APEs are listed on the New York Stock Excha=
nge, just like the common stock, and they have a fun name and a fun ticker =
and a lot of hype, so you never know. Yesterday about 151 million AMC share=
s traded, versus about 123 million APEs, so it=E2=80=99s not that far off.<=

<p style=3D"margin: 16px 0;">[8] As a corporate finance matter I would neve=

mber of unissued shares. It does not work that way at all! If a company iss=
ued hundreds of millions more shares, the price would go down. Still in the=
 limited meme-y case of AMC, where they had tons of demand for their stock =
and no supply, creating supply does seem like it could lead straightforward=
ly to selling that supply for money.</p>
