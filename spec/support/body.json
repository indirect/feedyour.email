I maintain the ledger in Microsoft Excel. Here is a copy of the ledger as of 9 a.m. today[2]:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to buy some of my quadrillion ExcelCoins, send me an email[3]; I will make a market at $0.99 bid \/ $1.01 offered,[4] though of course that is subject to change with market conditions.[5]\r\n\r\nOf course ExcelCoin started as a currency, a form of \u201cdigital cash,\u201d but what is powerful about the concept is that in principle you could track any sort of asset using the same underlying technology (me typing in Excel). For instance you could extend the ExcelCoin technology to track not merely fungible tokens like coins, but also non-fungible tokens, where each entry in the ledger represents a unique asset. For instance:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just a toy example \u2014 why would you want me to write \u201ca picture of a cat\u201d next to your name on a list? \u2014 but with a little imagination you can see how powerful it could be. For instance, we could track real estate this way. I could write down a list of all the houses in my town and who owns them; to transfer ownership we could just update the entries on my list. As of yet my list in Excel does not carry any legal ownership rights; it does not sync up with, or supersede, the legal property registry. But I think that you will agree that it is a much more efficient and technologically advanced system than the old legal system of property registration on paper in dusty archives, so I think in the long run it is likely to win out.\r\n\r\nThis is stupid, why is it stupid. The easy answer is that it is technologicallystupid. Actual cryptocurrencies (and blockchain systems for NFTs, proposed blockchains for real estate, etc.) have a distributed consensus mechanism <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9iaXRjb2luLm9yZy9iaXRjb2luLnBkZg\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B7ffa2eaf> for updating their shared ledger, proof-of-stake or proof-of-work or some other mechanism that lets the participants in the system verify and collectively control the ledger. Whereas I can type whatever I want in Excel. If you buy some ExcelCoins from me and I delete your entry in my Excel ledger, you don\u2019t have any ExcelCoins anymore, and what sort of system is that?\r\n\r\nA better answer is that it is socially stupid, because the person maintaining the ExcelCoin ledger is me, and I am obviously kidding. You should not trust me to maintain the ExcelCoin ledger, because I invented ExcelCoin as a joke about ledgers. On the other hand millions and millions of people own U.S. dollars, which means precisely <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTktMDYtMTgvZmFjZWJvb2std2lsbC1tYWtlLXRoZS1tb25leS1ub3c_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDExMDIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwMTEwJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B87f7f808> that some bank has a list and there is an entry for them on that list. It\u2019s probably not in Excel, but same basic idea: The bank has a list of dollars in its accounts, the list is not kept via any sort of consensus mechanism or blockchain or whatever; the bank just keeps the list using, uh, Cobol <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VhbHRoc2ltcGxlLmNvbS9lbi1jYS9tYWdhemluZS9jb2JvbC1jb250cm9scy15b3VyLW1vbmV5\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B2e13e55c>. But you (mostly) trust the bank to maintain the list, because among other things (1) it has a good track record of maintaining the list, (2) it has good commercial incentives to maintain the list, (3) it has powerful regulatory and legal incentives to maintain the list, etc.[6] The bank\u2019s list is not any great shakes technologically, and 100 years ago banks kept very similar lists using pen and paper. This system of lists is not flawless \u2014 sometimes the banks mess up the lists <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9zYW50YW5kZXItYmFuay1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktcGF5cy1wZW9wbGUtMTc1LW1pbGxpb24tY2hyaXN0bWFzLWRheS0yMDIxLTEy\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Bd108a0d1>! \u2014 but it is not howlingly stupid either, in the way that ExcelCoin is. It's very normal and standard and millions of people rely on it without thinking about it.[7] ExcelCoin is stupid not because I keep it in Excel; it's stupid because I keep it in Excel.\r\n\r\nOn Friday Moxie Marlinspike wrote a blog post <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb3hpZS5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMS8wNy93ZWIzLWZpcnN0LWltcHJlc3Npb25zLmh0bWw\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Bad6ff01c> on \u201cMy first impressions of web3.\u201d Marlinspike is a famous cryptographer and computer-security guy, the inventor of the Signal app, etc., and the post has gotten a ton of attention in the Web3 (and Web3-skeptical) world; it\u2019s great and I recommend it highly and I will only scratch the surface of it here. One relevant point is that distributed ledgers are not necessarily a complete technological solution for asset ownership:\r\n\r\nMost people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.\r\n\r\nInstead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there\u2019s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they\u2019d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they \u201cown\u201d the token). There\u2019s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image \u201cshould\u201d be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the \u201ccorrect\u201d image.\r\n\r\nSo as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked one way <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuc2VhLmlvL2Fzc2V0cy8weDVjNjFhZmE0NzU3MGFiMmI1NjI2MDZmYTU3ODIyMTMwNWIxMmMzMDcvMQ\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B62f745cd> on OpenSea, another way <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXJpYmxlLmNvbS90b2tlbi8weDVjNjFhZmE0NzU3MGFiMmI1NjI2MDZmYTU3ODIyMTMwNWIxMmMzMDc6MT90YWI9ZGV0YWlscw\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B18ffee31> on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large [poop] emoji. What you bid on isn\u2019t what you get. There\u2019s nothing unusual about this NFT, it\u2019s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into [poop] emoji at any time; I just made it explicit.\r\n\r\nThe NFT does not by itself convey ownership of the underlying thing in either a legal or practical sense. It conveys ownership in some more metaphysical sense: If you buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, then the people who are part of the BAYC NFT community will treat you as the owner of your ape. This is essentially a social fact and can be true even if the immutable code of the blockchain says that you don\u2019t own the ape, because you were hacked or whatever <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmljZS5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZS95M3YzbnkvYWxsLW15LWFwZXMtZ29uZS1uZnQtdGhlZnQtdmljdGltcy1iZWctZm9yLWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLXNhdmlvcnM\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1B903f0606>. The technology is a scaffolding on which to hang a social system, but the social system is what does or does not convey \u201cownership\u201d in a meaningful sense.\r\n\r\nAlso the technology is totally centralized? Marlinspike goes on:\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, without warning or explanation, the NFT I made was removed from OpenSea (an NFT marketplace). ...\r\n\r\nWhat I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device. This is web3, though, how is that possible?\r\n\r\nA crypto wallet like MetaMask, Rainbow, etc is \u201cnon-custodial\u201d (the keys are kept client side), but it has the same problem as my dApps above: a wallet has to run on a mobile device or in your browser. Meanwhile, ethereum and other blockchains have been designed with the idea that it\u2019s a network of peers, but not designed such that it\u2019s really possible for your mobile device or your browser to be one of those peers.\r\n\r\nA wallet like MetaMask needs to do basic things like display your balance, your recent transactions, and your NFTs, as well as more complex things like constructing transactions, interacting with smart contracts, etc. In short, MetaMask needs to interact with the blockchain, but the blockchain has been built such that clients like MetaMask can\u2019t interact with it. So like my dApp, MetaMask accomplishes this by making API calls to three companies that have consolidated in this space.\r\n\r\nFor instance, MetaMask \u2026 displays your NFTs by making an API call to OpenSea. ...\r\n\r\nAll this means that if your NFT is removed from OpenSea, it also disappears from your wallet. It doesn\u2019t functionally matter that my NFT is indelibly on the blockchain somewhere, because the wallet (and increasingly everything else in the ecosystem) is just using the OpenSea API to display NFTs, which began returning 304 No Content for the query of NFTs owned by my address!\r\n\r\nThe technology behind OpenSea is not quite \u201cOpenSea keeps a list, in Excel, of who owns which NFTs.\u201d The underlying list is kept on the blockchain; it\u2019s just that OpenSea can modify its version of the list however it wants, and its modifications are in practice pretty binding. And in fact there are regular rounds of stories in which (1) some gullible crypto guy hands out his private key to anyone who asks for it, (2) his NFTs get stolen, (3) he complains on Twitter, (4) he gets a major NFT marketplace to lock trading in his stolen NFTs, and (5) everyone writes articles like \u201cha ha ha you don\u2019t like decentralization so much now do you?\u201d \r\n\r\nThis is fine, though, Web3 proponents argue, because OpenSea\u2019s ability to act arbitrarily is limited by community standards. The open immutable blockchain still exists, so you can compare what OpenSea says to what the blockchain says. (Perhaps not with MetaMask, but the possibility exists.) If OpenSea\u2019s list did not conform to what its customers expected \u2014 if it arbitrarily ignored the blockchain, if it let people claim NFTs that weren\u2019t theirs, etc. \u2014 then everyone would take their apes elsewhere. But this is pretty much why people trust banks too! The essential protections are social, not technological.\r\n\r\nMarlinspike:\r\n\r\nWhen you think about it, OpenSea would actually be much \u201cbetter\u201d in the immediate sense if all the web3 parts were gone. It would be faster, cheaper for everyone, and easier to use. For example, to accept a bid on my NFT, I would have had to pay over $80-$150+ just in ethereum transaction fees. That puts an artificial floor on all bids, since otherwise you\u2019d lose money by accepting a bid for less than the gas fees. Payment fees by credit card, which typically feel extortionary, look cheap compared to that. OpenSea could even publish a simple transparency log if people wanted a public record of transactions, offers, bids, etc to verify their accounting.\r\n\r\nHowever, if they had built a platform to buy and sell images that wasn\u2019t nominally based on crypto, I don\u2019t think it would have taken off. Not because it isn\u2019t distributed, because as we\u2019ve seen so much of what\u2019s required to make it work is already not distributed. I don\u2019t think it would have taken off because this is a gold rush. People have made money through cryptocurrency speculation, those people are interested in spending that cryptocurrency in ways that support their investment while offering additional returns, and so that defines the setting for the market of transfer of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe people at the end of the line who are flipping NFTs do not fundamentally care about distributed trust models or payment mechanics, but they care about where the money is. So the money draws people into OpenSea, they improve the experience by building a platform that iterates on the underlying web3 protocols in web2 space, they eventually offer the ability to \u201cmint\u201d NFTs through OpenSea itself instead of through your own smart contract, and eventually this all opens the door for Coinbase to offer access to the validated NFT market with their own platform via your debit card. That opens the door to Coinbase managing the tokens themselves through dark pools that Coinbase holds, which helpfully eliminates the transaction fees and makes it possible to avoid having to interact with smart contracts at all. Eventually, all the web3 parts are gone, and you have a website for buying and selling JPEGS with your debit card. The project can\u2019t start as a web2 platform because of the market dynamics, but the same market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization will likely drive it to end up there.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, technologically, ExcelCoin is in some ways better than other forms of crypto that rely on distributed consensus mechanisms. But socially it is much worse, not only because I am kidding and have done nothing to build up trust in ExcelCoin, but also because there is an enormous speculative bubble in crypto that does not apply to transparently non-crypto things like my dumb Excel joke. The power of distributed consensus and immutable blockchains is not that they are a better technology than, you know, some large trusted website keeping a list, which is kind of how Web3 works anyway. The power of distributed consensus and immutable blockchains is that they attract money, which is\u00a0really\u00a0how Web3 works <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMTItMjEvdGhlcmUtcy1pbnNpZGUtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24taW4tc2VjLWZpbGluZ3M_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDExMDIyX01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjIwMTEwJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Bc610ba2a>.\r\n\r\n <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9zbGkuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9jbGljaz9zPTgyNTkyOSZsaT0yNjMxOTA2NiZtPTRjM2VkOTE3ZTU5MTU2YTM2MjEyZDQ4MTU1ODMxNDgyJnA9MjY0NDIxMDQmc3RwZT1kZWZhdWx0Jg\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Dce97dcfe>\r\n <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9zbGkuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9jbGljaz9zPTgyNTkzMyZsaT0yNjMxOTA2NiZtPTRjM2VkOTE3ZTU5MTU2YTM2MjEyZDQ4MTU1ODMxNDgyJnA9MjY0NDIxMDQmc3RwZT1kZWZhdWx0Jg\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Fec15dad0>\r\nChampertyCoin\r\nLast year, a bunch of people enjoyed speculating on meme stocks like GameStop Corp.

They want to sue Robinhood because they are angry, and, in America, suing people is a form of catharsis and emotional satisfaction. And they want to sue Robinhood because they think they have a valid claim and want to get monetary compensation for their losses from not being able to buy GameStop stock at, uh, $300 a share I guess. But there is a third desire that they might have, beyond emotional satisfaction and financial compensation: They might want to have another speculative frenzy. They might want to turn their grievance against Robinhood into a speculative asset, and then get rich trading it. \r\n\r\nYou might think that because:\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what everyone wants all the time, these days.

And to avoid obvious gaming of these rules, they tend to extend to the employee\u2019s family. If you work at a bank and your spouse is a schoolteacher, this is fine \u2014 though if your spouse is also a hobbyist stock trader you might have to make some difficult choices \u2014 but if you work at a bank and your spouse works at a hedge fund it seems harder. You can\u2019t really expect the hedge fund to get pre-approval from the bank. I suppose people work this stuff out \u2014 there are lots of financial-industry couples \u2014 but it does seem like in concept it would be challenging.\r\n\r\nAnyway <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMDgvam9uLW9zc29mZi1jb3VsZC1zbnViLW5hbmN5LXBlbG9zaS13aXRoLWJhbi1vbi1jb25ncmVzcy1zdG9jay10cmFkZXMv\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Bc8a44327>:\r\n\r\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff is looking to introduce a bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks \u2014 a practice that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended as her husband rakes in millions of dollars trading shares of tech companies, The Post has learned.\r\n\r\nThe Ossoff ethics bill, which the Democratic freshman Senator plans to introduce once he finds a Republican co-sponsor, would crack down on conflicts of interest by making it illegal for lawmakers and their families to trade stocks while in office, a Washington, D.C. source close to the situation said. \r\n\r\nIt would also likely require lawmakers put their assets in blind trusts \u2014 a step that the 34-year-old Ossoff completed himself months after being elected in January 2021. \r\n\r\nSeems rough if you\u2019re a congressperson married to a hedge fund manager but perhaps that is a feature, not a bug. I will say though that as far as I can tell most of the useful inside information that congresspeople get is about broad sectoral themes, not individual stocks; if you only own index funds and get a terrifying secret briefing about Covid <https:\/\/link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com\/click\/26319066.123038\/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjAtMDMtMjAvc2VuYXRvcnMtcGlja2VkLWEtZ29vZC10aW1lLXRvLXNlbGwtc3RvY2tzP2NtcGlkPUJCRDAxMTAyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDExMCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg\/5c18396decf12a5e0a3b2dd1Bb06daf5d>, you could profitably dump those index funds without ever trading an individual stock.

It would be faster, cheaper for everyone, and easier to use. For example, to accept a bid on my NFT, I would have had to pay over $80-$150+ just in ethereum transaction fees. That puts an artificial floor on all bids, since otherwise you\u2019d lose money by accepting a bid for less than the gas fees. Payment fees by credit card, which typically feel extortionary, look cheap compared to that. OpenSea could even publish a simple transparency log if people wanted a public record of transactions, offers, bids, etc to verify their accounting.<\/p><p style=\"margin: 16px 0px;\" class=\"\">However, if they had built a platform to buy and sell images that wasn\u2019t nominally based on crypto, I don\u2019t think it would have taken off.

That opens the door to Coinbase managing the tokens themselves through dark pools that Coinbase holds, which helpfully eliminates the transaction fees and makes it possible to avoid having to interact with smart contracts at all. Eventually, all the web3 parts&nbsp;<em class=\"\">are<\/em>&nbsp;gone, and you have a website for buying and selling JPEGS with your debit card.
